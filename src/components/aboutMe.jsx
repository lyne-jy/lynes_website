                    <p>I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at University of Calgary. I am passionate about
                        programming and problem-solving. I have proficiency in JavaScript, C++ and Java. I am a
                        quick learner and a team worker that gets the job done. I can easily capitalize on low
                        hanging fruits and quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas.</p>
